<br><br>
A small program that hooks PCSX2 memory address 0x205DE240.
<br><br>
This memory address was discovered by atlas. I personally believe this is the largest discovery in all research of the game.
<br><br>
Open PCSX2 and then run this application. The application should then latch onto PCSX2 and start dumping any updates to this memory address to a text file labelled 'dump_clean.txt' in the same directory as the application.
